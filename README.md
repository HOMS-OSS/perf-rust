# Ruperf

Timothy Maloney, Briana Oursler, Greg Hairfield, Sam Little, Michael Scherrer 2021

Ruperf is a Rust adaptation of the [linux perf command][1], also called perf_events.

## Goals

Our goal is to create a fast, reliable translation of `perf` in the Rust language with a least a couple software events implemented.


## RoadMap

Wk 3
*Prototype*

Implement Rust support for necessary Linux system calls in order to return a hardware event. These are
- `perf_event_open`
- `ioctl`
- `read`

Confirm by returning the `cycles` event.

Wk 6
*Minumum Viable Product* (MVP)

Hardware events
- cpu-cycles OR cycles
- instructions 
- L1-dcache-loads

Software events
- context switches
- cpu-clock
- task-clock

Wk 8
*Other support*

Minimal support to proof of concept these high-level commands.
- `perf-test`: runs assorted sanity tests
- `perf stat`: gathers performance counter statistics
- `perf record`: records a running program and outputs results to a file
- `perf report`: formats results in a friendly way.

The Future
*Extend support*
- Continue to build on `test`, `stat`, and `record` coverage. `Report` gathers
  statistics about performance and returns interesting tables or graphs.
- Support Windows and Mac platforms.
- Custom support for Rust program profiling.


## Requirements

Rust is required for this project.

It is recommended to download Rustup and install Rust.

In terminal type:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

More information about installing Rust [here][3].

Linux 5.x+ is required to run this project.
